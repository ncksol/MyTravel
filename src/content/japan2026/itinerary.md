> ⚠️ **SILVER WEEK 2026 — Days 1-5 overlap with a rare 5-day national holiday (Sep 19-23).** This only happens every 5-7 years and is one of Japan's busiest domestic travel periods — comparable to Golden Week. Expect extreme crowds at major attractions, higher hotel prices, and harder restaurant reservations. The itinerary has been structured to front-load off-beaten-path neighborhoods during Silver Week and save the most popular attractions for Day 6 (Thursday Sep 24) when the holiday ends.
>
> 🔴 **Holidays:** Mon Sep 21 = Respect for the Aged Day · Tue Sep 22 = Bridge Holiday · Wed Sep 23 = Autumnal Equinox Day

## Day 1 — Saturday, Sep 19: Arrival

- **14:30** Arrive Tokyo Haneda (HND)
- **~15:30** Clear immigration & customs
- **~16:00** Take monorail or Keikyu line to Akasaka (via Hamamatsucho or Shinagawa, transfer to Metro). ~45-60 min, ~¥700
- **17:00** Check into hotel, freshen up
- **18:30** Head to **Omoide Yokocho** (思い出横丁, "Memory Lane") near Shinjuku — narrow atmospheric alleyways packed with tiny yakitori stalls. Grab a few skewers and a beer, soak in the smoky, lantern-lit atmosphere. Try: negima (chicken & scallion), tsukune (meatball), kawa (crispy skin)
- **20:00** Optional: walk to nearby **Golden Gai** — a grid of ~200 micro-bars, each seating 5-10 people. A living relic of post-war Tokyo. Look for foreigner-friendly spots (check for signs). Cover charge ¥500-1,000. However, Golden Gai can feel overwhelming on a first night in Japan — the tiny bars and unspoken rules can be intimidating. If jet lag is hitting, the izakayas around Akasaka are a gentler alternative
- **Notes:** Keep it light — jet lag recovery. Grab a Suica/PASMO card at the airport (or set up mobile Suica on iPhone). Silver Week starts today — Shinjuku will be buzzing but Omoide Yokocho handles crowds well due to its tight layout

---

## Day 2 — Sunday, Sep 20: Hidden Tokyo Neighborhoods 🔴 Silver Week

**Theme: Off-beaten-path Tokyo — avoiding Silver Week crowds at major attractions**

> 💡 Senso-ji, Ueno, and other major attractions have been moved to Day 6 (post-Silver Week Thursday) when crowds return to normal. Today focuses on charming neighborhoods that domestic tourists don't flock to during holidays.

- **08:30** Breakfast at hotel or grab onigiri from a konbini
- **09:00** Head to **Yanaka** (谷中) via Metro (~20 min from Akasaka). This nostalgic neighborhood feels like old Tokyo — wooden houses, narrow lanes, temple-dotted hills. Explore **Yanaka Ginza** shopping street, try menchi katsu (fried meat croquette), spot the resident cats
- **10:30** Walk to **Nezu Shrine** (根津神社) — beautiful vermillion torii gate tunnel, rarely crowded even during Silver Week. One of Tokyo's oldest shrines
- **11:30** Walk to **Kagurazaka** (神楽坂) — the "Little Paris" of Tokyo. Cobblestone alleys, hidden shrines, French bakeries, traditional ryotei restaurants. Explore the yokocho (narrow lanes) — Hyogo Yokocho and Kakurenbo Yokocho are the best
- **12:30** Lunch in Kagurazaka — French-Japanese fusion bistro or a traditional ryotei
- **14:00** Walk or short metro to **Jimbocho** (神保町) — Book Town. Browse hundreds of vintage bookstores (many have English sections). Stop at a classic **kissaten** (retro coffee shop) — try Sabouru or Ladrio for the 1950s atmosphere

**Theme: Eastern Kyoto temple circuit**

The shrine is open 24/7 and free. Hike to the Yotsutsuji intersection (~1 hour round trip) for the best city views. The Senbon Torii (double row of gates) in the first 10 minutes is the iconic photo spot. Don't feel obligated to summit — gate density thins after halfway

**Theme: Arashiyama, golden temple, zen gardens**

- **08:00** Head to **Arashiyama** (嵐山) early by train (~20 min from downtown)
  - **Bamboo Grove** — walk through before 9am for fewer people
  - **Tenryu-ji Temple** (¥500) — beautiful Zen garden
  - If time: walk further to **Otagi Nenbutsu-ji** — 1,200 quirky stone statues, very few tourists
  - Or visit **Gio-ji** — tiny moss garden temple, magical atmosphere
- **12:00** Lunch in Arashiyama — try **matcha parfait** or tofu cuisine
- **13:30** Bus to **Kinkaku-ji** (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion, ¥500) — iconic, must-see
- **15:00** Walk to **Ryoan-ji** (龍安寺, ¥500, ~15 min walk from Kinkaku-ji) — Japan's most famous zen rock garden. Fifteen stones arranged on raked white gravel — you can never see all 15 at once from any angle. Deeply meditative

> 📌 **Kurama & Kibune:** This hike is a full-day commitment (transit + 1.5hr trail + shrine visit + lunch). It cannot be squeezed in after Kinkaku-ji — the transit alone takes 1+ hour and the trail would end in darkness by late September (sunset ~17:45). If Kurama-Kibune interests you, consider the **4-day Kyoto alternative** below which gives it a dedicated day, including the magical **kawadoko riverside dining** in Kibune (final week of the June-September season).

---

### 📌 Optional Side Trip: Uji (Half Day)

If you have free time during any Kyoto day, consider a half-day trip to **Uji** — just 20 min from Kyoto by JR Nara Line.

- **Byodo-in Temple** (平等院) — the temple on the ¥10 coin. Stunning Phoenix Hall reflected in a pond. National Treasure. ¥700 admission
- **Historic tea merchant street** — Uji is Japan's tea capital. Skip the matcha shops and explore **hojicha** (roasted green tea) and **sencha** tastings at centuries-old merchants
- **Uji River walk** — peaceful, scenic, uncrowded
- Can combine with Fushimi on the same rail line
- Best as a morning trip — allow 2-3 hours

- **14:30** Bus or walk down to Kibune-guchi Station, train back to Kyoto

**Theme: Street food capital, local neighborhoods**

- **09:00** Walk through **Kuromon Market** (黒門市場) — historically "Osaka's kitchen," now primarily a tourist-oriented market. Prices are inflated (especially seafood-on-sticks), and locals mostly avoid it. Worth a quick walk-through for the atmosphere and photos, but **save your appetite and money for Shinsekai** — the food is better and cheaper there

---

## Transit Summary

| Route | Method | Time | Cost (per person) |
|-------|--------|------|-------------------|
| HND → Akasaka | Keikyu + Metro | ~50 min | ~¥700 |
| Tokyo → Hakone | Romancecar (Shinjuku) | 85 min | ¥2,470 |
| Hakone → Kyoto | Romancecar to Odawara + Shinkansen | ~2.5 hrs | ~¥12,500 |
| Kyoto → Nara | JR or Kintetsu | 45 min | ¥720 |
| Nara → Osaka | Kintetsu to Namba | 40 min | ¥570 |
| Osaka → Tokyo | Shinkansen (Shin-Osaka) | 2h40m | ¥13,870 |
| Akasaka → HND | Metro + Monorail | ~50 min | ~¥700 |

**Total intercity transit for 2: ~¥61,500**

## JR Pass Verdict: ❌ Skip It

Individual tickets total ~¥30,750 per person for all intercity legs. A 7-day JR Pass costs ¥50,000 and wouldn't cover Tokyo→Hakone (Odakyu, not JR). Individual tickets save ~¥19,000 per person.
